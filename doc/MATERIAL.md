# Materials

Materials in Rex are described JSON5

Every material must define properties through JSON5

Information on how to read this schema is described [here](JSON5.md)

The top level schema of a material looks like:
```
{
  name:       required String
  textures:   required Array[#Texture]
  alpha_test: optional Boolean
  transform:  optional #MaterialTransform
}
```

`#Texture` schema looks like:
```
{
  file:       required String
  type:       required #TextureType
  filter:     required #Filter
  wrap:       required Array[#Wrap]
  mipmaps:    optional Boolean
}
```

`#TextureType` is a `String` that is one of:
  * `"albedo"`
  * `"normal"`
  * `"metalness"`
  * `"roughness"`

`#Filter` is a `String` that is one of:
  * `"nearest"`
  * `"bilinear"`
  * `"trilinear"`

When filter is `"trilinear"` `#Texture.mipmaps` is always treated as `true`

`#Wrap` is a `String` that is one of:
  * `"clamp_to_edge"`
  * `"clamp_to_border"`
  * `"mirrored_repeat"`
  * `"repeat"`
  * `"mirror_clamp_to_edge"`

`#MaterialTransform` schema looks like:
```
{
  scale:     optional Array[@Float, 2]
  rotate:    optional Array[@Float, 2]
  translate: optional Array[@Float, 2]
}
```

The `#MaterialTransform` is used to transform texture coordinates of the surface where the material is applied.
  * `scale` scale in `st` order.
  * `rotate` rotation in Euler angles (0 to 360Â°) in `st` order. Angles outside the range saturate.
  * `translate` translation in `st` order.

What is `S` and `T` depends on how the surface the material is applied on is modeled. The orientation depends on how the content was authored.

Artists should try to maintain a **+T is up and +S is right** coordinate system when UV mapping surfaces to follow the conventions of the engine which uses a **+Y up and +X right** coordinate system. This will decrease the confusion when using `#MaterialTransform`.

The behavior of material transforms is **highly** dependent on the wrap mode set in the textures of the material.
